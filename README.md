Charging the Way Forward: Forecasting EV Growth and Connecting Underserved Areas
As part of **CSU East Bay's Masters in Business Analytics (MSBA)** program, students are required to complete a Capstone project that demonstrates the analytical, technical, and strategic skills acquired throughout the program. This project, titled **"Charging the Way Forward: Forecasting EV Growth and Connecting Underserved Areas"**, addresses the critical challenge of ensuring equitable access to Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Washington State.

---

## Overview

Electric vehicles are essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainability goals. However, the rapid adoption of EVs has outpaced the development of charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. This project focuses on:

1. **Forecasting EV Growth**: Predicting EV population and charging station requirements.
2. **Analyzing Infrastructure Disparities**: Identifying underserved urban and rural areas.
3. **Developing Scalable Solutions**: Creating a reusable framework for data-driven infrastructure planning.

---

## Objectives

- **Analyze EV Growth Trends**: Utilize historical data to predict future EV adoption and infrastructure needs.
- **Identify Underserved Areas**: Examine urban-rural disparities in EV-to-charging station ratios.
- **Propose Scalable Solutions**: Develop strategies and tools adaptable to other regions.

---

## Methodology

- **Data Sources**: Washington State Department of Licensing EV dataset and Zip Code to County FIPS Crosswalk data.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Built using Apache Airflow and PySpark on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to clean, integrate, and prepare data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards in Tableau connected to Google BigQuery for real-time analysis.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Urban-Rural Divide**: Urban counties like King and Snohomish have robust EV adoption, but rural counties face significant infrastructure gaps.
2. **EV-to-Charging Station Ratios**: Rural areas exceed the recommended range, highlighting underserved regions.
3. **Projected Growth**: EV adoption in Washington is forecasted to surpass **250,000 by 2025**, necessitating proactive infrastructure expansion.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Rural Charging Networks**:
   - Prioritize underserved counties through public-private partnerships.
   - Encourage businesses to install workplace chargers in rural areas.

2. **Scale Urban Infrastructure**:
   - Upgrade and expand existing charging networks in high-adoption areas like King and Snohomish counties.
   - Focus on high-speed chargers in strategic locations to meet commuter demand.

3. **Implement Predictive Analytics**:
   - Use data-driven models to forecast EV adoption and infrastructure needs.
   - Avoid overbuilding in urban areas while addressing gaps in rural regions.

4. **Promote Equity and Accessibility**:
   - Offer incentives, such as tax rebates and home charging grants, to boost rural EV adoption.
   - Ensure a balanced distribution of charging stations statewide.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of **data-driven decision-making** in addressing EV infrastructure challenges. By forecasting growth, identifying underserved areas, and proposing scalable solutions, the project supports Washington State's transition to sustainable transportation while providing a framework adaptable to other states.
