Item 2: In the old dag, task_id='upload_local_csv_to_raw' only uploads one file from local
In the new dag, I need this task to upload multiple local csvs whos paths will also be provided in a variable 
in the secrets.py file as so -- local_csvs_loc = ['/opt/airflow/dags/data/ZIP-COUNTY-FIPS_2017-06.csv', '/opt/airflow/dags/data/alt_fuel_stations (Sep 21 2024).csv', '/opt/airflow/dags/data/Power_Plants.csv']

Item 3: Loading the data from transformed to bigquery will need to be adjusted to handle the multiple tables mentioned before.
